# Template Engine 

### Working History
I write a job log as I develop a new engine.

* [2019.06.25]
  * Copy header files in core/include directory - FSDK, LSDK and TrackEngine folders.
  * Copy libraries into the core/lib directory.
  * Copy the data folder to sample/resource However, the data folder is divided into cpu/gpu versions. 
    There seems to be only one version of the cpu and one version of the gpu. 
    And I think there will be a minimum of files required for each function used.
